    - Added some more modules to the SEE ALSO section
    - Various documentation improvements
    - Added github repo to the pod

1.08 2014-05-06 NEILB
    - Changed how the constants are defined, to deal with a change in 5.19.3
      "Closures of the form "sub () { $some_variable }" are no longer
       inlined, causing changes to the variable to be ignored by callers of
       the subroutine. [perl #79908]"
      RT#95387 - thanks to Slaven Rezic.
    - Changed use of \d to [0-9]

    - Playing with Devel::Cover, starting to improve coverage of testsuite

    - Specified MIN_PERL_VERSION as 5.006 in Makefile.PL

1.05 2013-09-06 NEILB
    - I'd got two versions wrong when merging the history information
      from the pod into Changes. As a result the previous release was
      failing conformance with CPAN::Changes::Spec

    - Bumped version so I can release, now the offending CORBA-IDL
      release has been deleted from CPAN.

1.03 2013-09-02 NEILB
    - Added links to enumeration modules in SEE ALSO section.
    - Failed to index, due to clash with Enum module in CORBA-IDL

1.02 2013-09-01 NEILB
    - Added links to other modules and my review, in SEE ALSO
    - Failed to index, due to clash with PAUSE permissions for Enum module

    - Neil Bowers (NEILB) has taken over maintenance from Byron (thanks Byron!)
    - Reformatted this file (Changes) as per CPAN::Changes::Spec
    - Some of the revision history was in this file, some was in the pod;
      I think I've merged them correctly.
    - Added licence and repository metadata to Makefile.PL
