Text::FormatTable
=================

DESCRIPTION

  Text::FormatTable renders simple tables as text. You pass to the constructor
  a table format specification similar to LaTeX (e.g. "r|l|l") and you call
  methods to fill the table data and insert rules. After the data is filled,
  you render the table as text.
